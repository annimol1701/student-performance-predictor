# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This project uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on how many hours they study and their attendance percentage.

## 📌 Features
- Simple dataset using pandas
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Predicts student success

## 📂 File
- `student_vegeta.py`: Python file that contains all the ML code.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python student_vegeta.py
   ```
