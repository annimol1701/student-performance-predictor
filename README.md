# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

This project uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on how many hours they study and their attendance percentage.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Simple dataset using pandas
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Predicts student success

## ðŸ“‚ File
- `student_vegeta.py`: Python file that contains all the ML code.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure you have the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python student_vegeta.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Example Prediction
The model predicts based on:
- `hours_studied`
- `attendance`

For example:
- Input: `6 hours`, `80% attendance`
- Output: **Pass**
- ## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The **Student Performance Predictor** aims to visualize and analyze student performance using subject-wise marks. This helps identify strengths and areas of improvement, and lays the foundation for predictive modeling in the future.

## ðŸ“Š ARC Output

Below is a sample Academic Result Chart (ARC) generated using Python and Matplotlib:
